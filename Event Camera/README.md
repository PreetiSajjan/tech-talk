# Event Camera - A shift towards next-generation performance and efficiency for computer vision

## Overview
* Tech talk was given for the Waterford Tech Meetup on the 15-02-2023
* We will first understand what Computer Vision is along with details on the techniques followed by applications
* Then we dive into interesting topic, Event Camera. We here try to cover how Event Camera are different than Standard Camera, their working principle, and a few real-world applications
* Lastly, some thoughts on the active researchs in the field of computer vision with respect to Event Cameras

## Abstract
An event camera is also known as a neuromorphic camera, silicon retina, or dynamic vision sensor. Event Cameras are the cameras triggered by changes in brightness within the frame. These cameras offer attractive properties compared to traditional cameras: high temporal resolution, very high dynamic range, low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth resulting in reduced motion blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision
